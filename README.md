## about
Citation is a small mobile and desktop HTML5 game made in the amazing open-source Godot Game Engine. You play as a fledgling, if not forgetful scholar of magic on a hunt for your lost notes. In the process, you’ll absorb some common and not-so-common sense knowledge about what it means to be an ethical scholar. This is our first full game as a [hallpass studios](https://hallpass.games) and we all learned a lot about what it takes to make a performant, interesting and educational web game.

Note: You’ll need to read this case study on academic integrity in order to complete the game!
