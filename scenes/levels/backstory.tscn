Another aspect that makes the school unique, and frankly, what makes it such a draw for the world's best and brightest, is that it is located above an ancient, unexplored source of magical energy: [color=red]THE RATIO[/color]. 

The magical energy emanating from the depths below Dream School seems to exist in two competitive states at once. The scholars from long long ago named these states of energy [color=yellow]ethical[/color] energy, and [color=red]unethical[/color] energy. You remember being told that it's like the distinction between good magic and evil evil magic, but that's not exactly the best analogy - unethical magic and ethical magic can have the same outcomes, but only in the short term. Long-term, unethical magic damages the very fabric of society, corrupting those who pursue the mystical arts as a way to help society progress and improve. Casting unethical spells can not only get you kicked out of Dream School, but can also cause the entire community to become a worse place."
